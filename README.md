# Pig Traditional Dice Game
Created by Ryan Lamb
## Rules
* 2-4 players
* Rolls form highest to greatest for the order of playing (precalculates before game starts)
* You can either decide on your turn to keep rolling or to cash in the points you earned during your turn to your score
* If you roll a 1 you get nothing added to your score and your turn ends
* If you roll 2-6 it will be added to the turn score which can be added to your score if you choose to put your turn on hold
* Get to 100 points in total to win
## Features
I added a feature that allows you to choose what type each of the participants in the game are, you can have 4 players or 2 players and 2 AIs or all AIs and just watch the bots battle it out.
I also tried to make the AI able to randomly go for a conservative or an all in stance every round they enter.
